                <p class="text-center i">
                    Universal Stationery began with a simple idea — to make quality stationery accessible for everyone, no matter their background or budget. Starting as a small local shop, we served our first customers with only a few products but with a big dream in our hearts. Over time, we realized that stationery is not just pens and paper; it is about enabling people to learn better, work smarter, and express creativity freely. With this belief, we expanded step by step, building partnerships with trusted brands like Dollar, Pilot, Pelikan, Staedtler, Faber-Castell, and Staples, and reaching out to schools, offices, and individuals across Pakistan. Today, Universal Stationery is not just a supplier of pens and notebooks — it is a name that represents reliability, innovation, and growth.
